Foreword:

Hi All, I'm Astri. I've been playing the Soulsborne games since Demon's Souls starting ~2010, so you may have seen or heard of me at some point. Demon's Souls was my first online game and stands as one of my favorite games of all time. I've easily poured thousands of hours into it, creating new builds, partaking in jolly co-operation, dueling, and invading. I was one of only a handful of pure mages frequenting the NA PvP scene and am primarily known for my skill with spellcasting tech. I'm also a moderator of the Demon's Souls discord, although I have not been very active there in a long time.

After the release of the Demon's Souls remake in 2020 and feeling disappointment in the shape it was left in (password summons not downscaled, negative luck, guaranteed wakeups after backstab, etc.), I decided to start the ambitious project of modding the original game. My vision was a massive overhaul to improve game balance and promote build diversity while still preserving the heart and soul of the original version (making changes that are neither detrimental to the PvE nor PvP experience). I frankly had no modding experience prior to this, nor do I have any practical background in coding, but with a lot of determination, three full restarts of the project due to file corruption, and occasional guidance from incredibly nice people in the Souls modding community like ariane_des and georgekingbore, I was able to bring this idea to fruition.

It is not a very flashy mod, nor was it meant to be. The changes were designed to blend in with the rest of the game as much as possible, as if they were always meant to be there. All file edits were made by my own hands in DSAnimStudio and DSMapStudio, using assets that already exist in the game for new spells and moveset modifications. It is truly a labor of love that I hope you all enjoy.

The mod files are divided into the root path they should go in. Drag and drop the files within your game folders matching their respective root paths to replace the vanilla files. On PC, it will prompt you asking if you want to replace the files for every file. DO NOT DRAG AND DROP WHOLE FOLDERS. I have NOT included the vanilla files.
