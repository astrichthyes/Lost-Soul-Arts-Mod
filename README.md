Project Astri - "Lost Soul Arts" Mod

Foreword:

Hi All, I'm Astri. I've been playing the Soulsborne games since Demon's Souls starting ~2010, so you may have seen or heard of me at some point. Demon's Souls was my first online game and stands as one of my favorite games of all time. I've easily poured thousands of hours into it, creating new builds, partaking in jolly co-operation, dueling, and invading. I was one of only a handful of pure mages frequenting the NA PvP scene and am primarily known for my skill with spellcasting tech. I'm also a moderator of the Demon's Souls discord, although I have not been very active there in a long time.

After the release of the Demon's Souls remake in 2020 and feeling disappointment in the shape it was left in (password summons not downscaled, negative luck, guaranteed wakeups after backstab, etc.), I decided to start the ambitious project of modding the original game in May 2021. My vision was a massive overhaul to improve game balance and promote build diversity while still preserving the heart and soul of the original version (making changes that are neither detrimental to the PvE nor PvP experience). I frankly had no modding experience prior to this, nor do I have any practical background in coding, but with a lot of determination, after three full restarts of the project due to file corruption, and with occasional guidance from incredibly nice people in the Souls modding community like ariane_des and georgekingbore, I was able to bring this idea to fruition.

This is not a very flashy mod, nor was it meant to be. The changes were designed to blend in with the rest of the game as much as possible, as if they were always meant to be there. All file edits were made by my own hands in DSAnimStudio and DSMapStudio, using assets that already exist in the game for new spells and moveset modifications. It is truly a labor of love that I hope you all enjoy.

----------------------------------

What's in Lost Soul Arts:

-Improved starting classes

-Slightly changed some spells and miracles....

-Some spells and miracles replaced with new ones....

-Most weapons rebalanced/revamped

-Modified function/scaling of some upgrade paths

-Some weapon movesets slightly modified....

-Reduced backstab multipliers for all weapons except fist weapons

-Armor weights and defenses now more fashion-friendly

-Grass, spice, and status effects now percentage-based effects-over-time (note: status no longer displays properly because it is only calculated from flat effects)

-Status effect duration adjusted

-Misc QoL changes

-Modified some dev messages in the Nexus and Stonefang....

-Changed some enemy placement....

-Changed the behavior and equipment of some NPC's

-Friendly scale miners are hiding throughout Boletaria....

*Tip: Read item and weapon descriptions. A lot has changed. Some changes may not be obvious otherwise.*

**Please note that there are a couple of known issues: Some spells and miracles do not show up in shops at the right time (after defeating the boss whose soul you use to purchase them). Status also does not display properly on weapons. I'm working on these, but may not be able to fix them if they're hardcoded.**
